# AI Prompt Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application that demonstrates my proficiency in Django (backend) and TypeScript with React (frontend). It's an AI Prompt Management System that allows users to create, read, update, and delete AI prompts. The application showcases a modern architecture using Django Rest Framework for the backend API and React with TypeScript for the frontend, all integrated with Supabase for authentication and database management.

## Key Technical Highlights

### Backend (Django & Django Rest Framework)

1. **Custom Authentication**: Implemented a custom authentication backend to integrate Supabase JWT authentication with Django's authentication system.
2. **RESTful API**: Developed a comprehensive RESTful API using Django Rest Framework, demonstrating best practices in API design.
3. **Database Integration**: Utilized Django's ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, showcasing database design and management skills.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Implemented environment-based configuration management using python-dotenv for secure and flexible deployment.

### Frontend (React & TypeScript)

1. **TypeScript Integration**: Utilized TypeScript throughout the React application, demonstrating strong typing and enhanced code quality.
2. **State Management**: Implemented efficient state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) and context API when necessary.
3. **API Integration**: Created a robust API integration layer using Axios, handling authentication tokens and API requests/responses.
4. **Component Architecture**: Designed a modular component architecture, showcasing reusability and separation of concerns.

### Full-Stack Integration

1. **Authentication Flow**: Implemented a seamless authentication flow between the frontend and backend, using Supabase for user management and JWT token handling.
2. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured CORS settings to ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.
3. **Environment Consistency**: Ensured consistency between frontend and backend environments, demonstrating DevOps best practices.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Django and Django Rest Framework, following a layered architecture:

1. **URL Routing**: Defined in `urls.py`, mapping URLs to appropriate views.
2. **Views**: Implemented using ViewSets in `views.py`, handling HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Serializers**: Defined in `serializers.py`, responsible for data validation and serialization/deserialization.
4. **Models**: Represent database schema, defined in `models.py`.
5. **Authentication**: Custom authentication backend in `authentication.py` to integrate Supabase with Django.
6. **Settings**: Project configuration in `settings.py`, including database, authentication, and third-party integrations.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a React application written in TypeScript, structured as follows:

1. **Components**: Reusable UI components (`Login.js`, `Register.js`, `PromptList.js`, `PromptForm.js`).
2. **API Integration**: Axios for API calls, with authentication token management.
3. **Routing**: React Router for client-side routing.
4. **State Management**: React hooks for local state management, with potential for global state management using Context API or Redux if needed.
5. **Styling**: Material-UI for consistent and responsive design.

### Database Schema

The primary model is the `AIPrompt`:

```python
class AIPrompt(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_by = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # Stores Supabase user ID
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/prompts/`: List all prompts for the authenticated user
- `POST /api/prompts/`: Create a new prompt
- `GET /api/prompts/{id}/`: Retrieve a specific prompt
- `PUT /api/prompts/{id}/`: Update a specific prompt
- `DELETE /api/prompts/{id}/`: Delete a specific prompt

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Authentication**: Implemented secure JWT-based authentication using Supabase.
2. **CORS**: Properly configured CORS settings to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information stored in environment variables.
4. **Input Validation**: Implemented thorough input validation on both frontend and backend.

## Scalability and Performance

1. **Database Indexing**: Proper indexing on frequently queried fields for optimal performance.
2. **Pagination**: Implemented pagination for list endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Caching**: Potential for implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for real-time prompt updates.
2. **Advanced Search**: Add full-text search capabilities for prompts.
3. **User Roles**: Implement role-based access control for different user types.
4. **Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track prompt usage and performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development using Django and TypeScript. It showcases my ability to design and implement a scalable, secure, and efficient web application, integrating modern technologies and following best practices in software development.
